The above XML file is a complex one and represents a library with multiple books and videos. Each book and video contains several child elements such as title, author/year for books and title, director/year for videos. Books have two attributes, id, and author-id. Videos also have two attributes, id, and director-id but not author-id. This gives a real world example of validation in XML. The different types of elements, such as CDATA, PCData, EMPTY, attribute values,etc. demonstrate the full strength of the language. There is also a main element ‘library’ which serves as the parent and aggregates all book and video elements together. The notes and comments provided provide the encased expansion that resembles clear validation during testing while but proof that the process endured multiple cascaded stored length squeez treatments.
