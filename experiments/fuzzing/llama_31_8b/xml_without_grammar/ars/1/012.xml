    <title>Hope is the Thing with Feathers</title>
    <verses>
        <verse>
            Hope is the Thing with Feathers—
            That Perches in our Soul—
            And sings the Tune without the words—
            And never stops—at all—
        </verse>
        <verse>
            And sweetest in the Gale is heard;
            And sore must be the Storm
            That could abash the little Bird
            That kept so many warm—
        </verse>
    </verses>
