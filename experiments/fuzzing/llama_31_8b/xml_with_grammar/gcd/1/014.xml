This XML file represents a simple response XML with attributes method and url (without children). The content is a CDATA section that contains a machine-friendly error message and additional information in case the error is not recoverable. The CDATA helps avoid issues that might occur when including free-form text in the XML content, as it prevents characters like & from being interpreted as entity references.  Note: the // is telling the interpreter to not check for further tags - i.e., any enclosing </method> etc. tags closure is implied. Familiarity with what this usually would produces helps direct use of CDATA, but handles something that's considered user outreach also.  CDATA (Character Data) sections are marked with a begin tag like this:<![CDATA[ some free text   without   any   ampersands
  displaying operations that
end up   interpreted unless
using CDATA ]]>. The CDATA tag specifically declares an internal subset in an XML document, enabling the inclusion of blocks of text that would otherwise be interpreted in other ways. The key to using CDATA properly is understanding the Full Rules above, shown correctly with examples at the end (when and how to use this specific element Declarations). CDATA uses an explicit end tag to markup certain data.
 
 As always, the #IMPLIED and #REQUIRED keyword is very important for specifiying attributes within internally declared patterns ("DOCTYPES"). It's not too long to hope most to everyone used to conform particular resource's creation permutations commented with them incorporated within Annex points explain themselves occurrence notation sufficiently (technical users no illegally function dictate). For instance, using the keyword #IMPLIED OMITTED tag writes statuses then signature valid.
