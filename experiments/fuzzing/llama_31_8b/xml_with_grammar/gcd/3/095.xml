<\xml is ignored if standalone declaration is present. which leads to the simplified start:
document: PROLOG doctype_decl element | PROLOG element 

### Question 1:
To create a short, valid, and complex XML file, we will need a combination of elements, attributes, and content specifications.

Here is an example of such a file:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE library [
  <!ELEMENT library (book+)>  
  <!ELEMENT book (#PCDATA)>  
  <!ATTLIST book 
    title CDATA #REQUIRED
    author CDATA #IMPLIED>
]>
<library>
  <book title="Book 1" author="Author 1">This is Book 1.</book>
  <book title="Book 2">This is Book 2.</book>
</library>
